Segmentation

Run rembg with the isnet-general-use model for a finer, hair-friendly binary mask.

Trimap Generation

In Python/OpenCV, take that mask, do a small dilation and erosion to get a three-region trimap (sure-foreground, sure-background, unknown).

Deep Matting

Feed your original image + trimap into MODNet (or FBA Matting) to predict a soft alpha matte.

Post-Processing

Apply an OpenCV guided filter and a morphological closing to smooth and repair small holes.

Compositing (optional)

Merge your new alpha matte with any background—or export as a clean PNG.

With this, you get:

True soft edges (no jagged hairlines)

No paywalls and full privacy (runs on your servers)
