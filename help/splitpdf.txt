**Split PDF Tool Specification**

**1. Overview**
The "Split PDF" tool enables users to break a single PDF document into multiple independent PDF files according to page ranges, page count, or file size constraints. Users can quickly upload one PDF file via drag‑and‑drop or file selector, configure split parameters through an intuitive control panel, preview results, and download the outputs as individual files or a ZIP archive.
